# AutoPost-Fiverr-to-WordPress-
Bot AutoPost (get data from Fiverr and posted on WordPress)

I created this Script with a simple GUI in order to facilitate my work, in order to do my job, which requires me to copy the gigs data from Fiverr (title-img-description-affiliate link ) and posted it on WordPress in the form of an article with pasting affiliate links.

This script consists of 414 lines of code (Python).

I know that it is an easy thing for professional programmers and not that difficult, but it is normal for me because I am still on my way to professionalism and I have not yet become a professional, like any aspiring programmer I always try to improve my skills in order to keep pace with the development of all technologies.

Script actions steps:

1-browse category on fiverr to get links of 8 gigs or more .
2-browse all link gigs one by one and copy all data I need (data: title-img-description-affiliate link)
3-browse affiliate fiverr site to make a short link of affiliate link with form button (HTML).
4-browse WordPress site and login
5-browse new post
6-past all data one by one as an article form
7-click publish button

Libraries I use in this script :

Tkinter : create GUI for script python.

Selenium Webdriver : create autotest, scraping information from different websites like Fiverr.

Pyautogui : Used to programmatically control the mouse & keyboard.

Pickle : give you the option to save data like(email&pass of WordPress) into file.dat and use them later without entering it again and again.

pyinstaller : make you able to convert your script.py to app.exe (work on any windows without IDLE).
My English is not so good. so thank you for your visit I hope you contact me if you need anything.
